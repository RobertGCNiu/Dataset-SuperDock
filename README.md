SuperDock: A Deep Learning-Based Automatic Floating Garbage Inspection System

## River Semantic Segmentation
We will use DeeplabV3+ to segment the river captured from UAV. 

For different heights, we should train for different models.

## Obstacle Avoidance
During the inspection, the UAV will move along with river. Obstacle avoidance must be considered in the movement since the bridges or buildings around river.
